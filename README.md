# InstaBot - demo

The bot that using selenium opens a browser, logs into my own instagram account then open a page of selected user and looks for any new added photos or videos.

If during the time of work of the InstaBot the new post has been added then the Bot opens the newest photography or video, likes it and comments it with a selected message.
